# A Graph Theorist's Sketchpad

## Summary

The project is a webapp developed as my final project for the course MATH/CPT_S 453 Graph Theory at WSU for Fall 2020.

It is a graph sketchpad, allowing the user to sketch a graph and perform various graph operations.

I made heavy use of the Javascript library Fabric.js (http://fabricjs.com/).

## Files
### dist
Contains 'intex.html' and 'style.css' which I used to style the webapp.\
'main.js' is built by Node.js. It is a combination of 'index.js' and Node.js library code.

### node_modules
Node.js library stuff.

### src
Contains 'index.js' which is where I did all my scripting.

## Instructions to Run Locally
If you want to run the webapp locally, you only need the 'dist' folder. I would not reccomend downloading the entire ~100mb project unless you plan to develop it. For the scripting implementation, see 'index.js' in the 'src' folder.

Open 'index.html' in a modern browser to run. I have not tested this on anything other than an updated Chrome on Windows 10 (December 2020).
